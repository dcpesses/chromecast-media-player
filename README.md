Simple Media Playback for Google Chromecast 

As user [pjjanak](http://github.com/pjjanak) noted in his [chromecast-hello-world](http://github.com/pjjanak/chromecast-hello-world) project, there's a "woefully incomplete amount of [documentation](https://developers.google.com/cast/)" on developing for the Google Chromecast.  Their project is a fantastic start, but it's also a simple "Hello World" to demo how the Sender and Receiver can be setup.

What I'm attempting here is sort of a "Chapter 2".  While not directly based upon the above project, it can and should integrate nicely with the foundation they've already established.
